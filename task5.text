Abstractions in Travel Services:


	Travel agencies and booking  platform act  as  in the  context of my journey .they  provide a simplified interface for  traveler to  access various travel services ,such as flights,


During  the journey  I can switch between different  travel agencies  or GPS app without altering  my  travel plan.


Ease of Maintenance:


	In  travel  context if  a travel agency  changes its offerings or partnership  with  airlines or hotels .It shouldn't  disturb my  travel  plans and stay  flexible and adaptable even if the details change.
